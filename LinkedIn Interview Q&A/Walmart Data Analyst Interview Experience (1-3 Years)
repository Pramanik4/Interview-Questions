SQL Questions -

 1. Write a query to find the second-highest salary in a department. You might use ROW_NUMBER() or DENSE_RANK() to achieve this.
 SOLUTION:


 2. Create a query to calculate the total number of transactions per user for each day. This typically involves GROUP BY and COUNT() for aggregation.
 3. Write a query to select projects with the highest budget-per-employee ratio from two related tables (projects and employees). This tests your ability to handle complex joins and aggregations.

Power BI Questions - 

 1. Explain the difference between Import and Direct Query modes. Which would you choose for large datasets? (Direct Query enables real-time data but may be slower, whereas Import is faster but static.)
 SOLUTION:
 In simple terms, when dealing with large datasets, I would choose DirectQuery mode over Import mode because DirectQuery allows you to work with real-time data 
 without the limitation of data size, as it doesn't require loading the entire dataset into memory. However, it's important to note that DirectQuery may be slower 
 in terms of performance, as queries are executed live against the data source.

 On the other hand, Import mode can provide faster query performance because the data is loaded into memory. However, it is not suitable for very large datasets 
 because it has limitations on the amount of data you can import and is static â€” it doesn't reflect real-time changes unless you refresh the data manually.

 So, if you need up-to-date information and the dataset is too large for Import mode, DirectQuery would be the better choice. However, if performance is a 
 top priority and the data size is manageable, Import mode would be more efficient.

 2. What are slicers, and how do they differ from visual-level filters? Discuss their impact on data in a Power BI dashboard.
 SOLUTION:
 Slicers are interactive, user-friendly filters that allow users to filter data across multiple visuals on a report page. 
 They are visible on the report.
 Visual-level filters, on the other hand, are applied to individual visuals and are typically set by the report designer. 
 These filters are found in the filter pane and are not visible to the end-user.


 3. How do you implement Row-Level Security (RLS) in Power BI? Explain how you would restrict data access to specific users or groups.
 4. What is a paginated report, and when would you use it? These are ideal for multi-page outputs like invoices or billing statements.

Python Questions -

 1. Write a Python script to identify unique values in a list and count their occurrences. This tests your understanding of sets and dictionaries.
 2. How would you use pandas to merge two datasets and calculate total sales for products with valid promotions? This involves merge(), groupby(), and basic data analysis functions.
 3. Explain the differences between lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries in Python, highlighting their use cases in data manipulation and analysis.
