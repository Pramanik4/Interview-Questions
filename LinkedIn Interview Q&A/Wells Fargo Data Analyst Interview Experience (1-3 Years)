 1. You have a table Accounts with columns AccountID, CustomerID, Balance, and LastTransactionDate. 
    Write a query to identify accounts that have been inactive for more than 12 months.
SOLUTION :
SELECT * FROM ACCOUNTS
WHERE LASTTRANSACTION_DATE < DATEADD(MONTH, -12, GETDATE());

 2. Given a table Transactions with columns TransactionID, AccountID, Amount, and TransactionDate. 
    find the top 3 accounts with the highest total transaction volume for each month.
SOLUTION :
SELECT TOP 3 ACCOUNTID, MAX(SUM(AMOUNT)) FROM TRANSACTIONS
GROUP BY ACCOUNTID

SOLUTION 1 :
WITH TOTAL_AMOUNT AS (
SELECT ACCOUNTID,SUM(AMOUNT)AS AMT FROM TRANSACTIONS
GROUP BY ACCOUNTID
)

SELECT TOP 3 ACCOUNTID, AMT FROM TOTAL_AMOUNT
ORDER BY AMT DESC;

SOLUTION 2 :
SELECT TOP 3 ACCOUNTID, SUM(AMOUNT) AS AMT FROM TRANSACTIONS
GROUP BY ACCOUNTID
ORDER BY AMT DESC;


 3. A table LoanApplications contains columns ApplicationID, CustomerID, LoanAmount, ApprovalStatus, and ApplicationDate. 
    Write a query to calculate the average loan amount for approved applications submitted in the last six months.
SELECT CUSTOMER_ID, AVG(LoanAmount) FROM LOAN_APPLICATIONS
WHERE APPROVAL_STATUS = 'Approved'
AND APPLICATION_DATE >= DATEADD(MONTH, -6, GETDATE())


 4. Explain how a clustered index works and how it differs from a non-clustered index.
 5. Describe a scenario where you would use a self-join in SQL and explain its benefits.

PYTHON
 6. Write a Python script to process a JSON file containing customer data and convert it into a structured DataFrame.

FILE : json_file.json
{
"name": "Pooja Pramanik",
"age": 20,
"country": "India"
}

SOLUTION:
import pandas as pd
import json

with open('json_file.json', 'r') as f:
  data = json.load(f)

data = [data]

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)

 8. Explain how you would use Python to validate and clean data received from an external source (e.g., removing duplicates, handling null values, etc.).
 9. Write a Python program to identify and report outliers in a numerical dataset using the interquartile range (IQR) method.
